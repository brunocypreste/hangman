# hangman
In this project I will make a hangman game for terminal in Python. As my first project, it have purposes of learn Python, GitHub, system design, documentation in english, and among others.

The Python's choice is because of Python is a powerful programming language, and in my Production Engeneering course at UFES I have to learn Python to Data Science. So is it, I took this advantage to star a project and learn more about.
